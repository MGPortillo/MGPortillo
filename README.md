- 👋 Hi, I’m @MGPortillo
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, more specifically software developing!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop in HTML, CSS and JavaScript! Once I have a stronger grasp on these, I'll begin tackling languages like Java or Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many projects moving forward! I'm excited especially to be learning SQL for database design!
- 📫 How to reach me? Preferably via my CT State email at 01848281@student.commnet.edu.
